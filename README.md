# ModelingInfectiousDiseases.jl

This code recreates the programmes from http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/ into Julia. 

The code is presented in a package. You may install the whole package and use functions from it, or copy individual programmes from the `src` folder. Functions in that folder are grouped by book chapter.  

So far, programmes up to chapter 2, programme 2.2 have been added.
