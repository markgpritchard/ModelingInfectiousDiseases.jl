# ModelingInfectiousDiseases.jl

This code recreates the programmes from http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/ into Julia. These are from the book Keeling, M.J. and Rohani, P. *Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals*. Princeton University Press (2007). The code is being developed as a learning exercise. It is not associated with the authors or publishers of the book, and is saved here in 'as is' form.

The code is presented in a package. You may install the whole package and use functions from it, or copy individual programmes from the `src` folder. Functions in that folder are grouped by book chapter.  

So far, programmes up to chapter 2, programme 2.2 have been added.
